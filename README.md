## 🚀 Why Use This Tool?

Pokemon GO's search syntax is powerful but hard to remember. Instead of typing `4*&shiny&!shadow&year2016-2020`, just click the filters you want and copy the generated string.

Perfect for:

- Finding Pokemon for lucky trades

- IV hunting and appraisal filtering

- Move-based searches for raids/PvP

- Storage management and organization

- Event Pokemon with special backgrounds
