## 💡 Ideas Under Consideration

### Features Being Evaluated
- **Appraisal Screenshot Parser** - Technical complexity vs. benefit
- **Breakpoint Calculator** - May be out of scope, better as separate tool
- **IV Rank Checker** - Requires significant calculation logic
- **Compact View Toggle** - Need to assess if necessary
- **Search Macros** - Chain multiple searches together

### Community Requests
*This section will be updated based on Discord feedback and user suggestions*

---

## 🚫 Not Planning

### Features We Won't Add
- **Completed Dex Entry Checker** - Not possible with Pokemon GO's native search operators
- **Event Costume Trash Lists** - Many users collect these, too subjective
- **IV Difference Calculators** - Minimal practical difference, out of scope
- **Evolution Fodder Lists** - Lucky eggs less relevant now, not a priority
- **Temporary Cup-Specific Searches** - Too much maintenance, meta changes too fast
